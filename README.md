# 502Finder
## This is B's website. Currently the SQL database holds no data.
## In order to get data into the DB, we'll need to rewrite the scraping code.
## As a result of the last scraping, the sites have responded and change their code to make it hard to scrape.
## I can still scrape it, but getting every strain in & dispensary will require barter/trade before that begins.
## Before they changed their code, it was easy, not it's all javascript related which means I can't do it in
## straight C#, I have to automate a web browser to do the clicking and snatch the text from there.
